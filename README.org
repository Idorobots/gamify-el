* Gamify

Gamify is an Emacs package that will turn your ordinary, boring day-to-day Emacs experience into something awesome!
Well, not really... You can use it to track your soft and professional skills developement while keeping you motivated to do stuff such as your [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] tasks and enhancing your productivity.

* Installation

You can use =use-package= together with =quelpa= to install Gamify directly from this repository:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package quelpa)
(quelpa '(gamify :repo Idorobots/gamify-el :fetcher github))
#+end_src

Alternatively, copy all the =.el= files into a directory in your Emacs =load-path= and optionally =byte-compile-file= them.

* Customization

There are quite a few tweakable variables. Just check the source, dang it!

* Stuff TODO

- Add achievements and similar stuff for even more awesomeness.
